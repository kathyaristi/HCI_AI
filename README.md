# HCI Mini Coding Assignment 2

Steps to run:

Please replace the API key with you api key.
In terminal type npm run dev

This program asks open ai to display hello world in 10 different languages, feel free to play around with the number to see different outputs.

Reflection:

I had never previously used any generative AI API and was also pretty new to React, so I had to read the documentation on how to integrate open AIâ€™s API in a react app and what the correct syntax was for the connection. One challenge I still continue to face is that when I run the js file with my openai api key added to my bash profile, the call to the api works and I get a response. But once I add it to my app.tsx file the browser does not recognize that I have an API key set which is why the only way it would work was by putting the API key in the code. In the end, I learned a lot about how to integrate an API into my application as well as how I can display information the AI generates, onto a webapp. This is extremely useful for my project on Planning hangouts with friends since we want to incorporate an AI suggestion feature where the AI can offer fun things to do in the nearby area for groups of friends.
